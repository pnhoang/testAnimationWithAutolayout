# About

This project is a test project that try to show/hide a UIView by using Autolayout constraint. 
The constraint is setup in the Storyboard and then later be animated down and up from the view by adding/substracting a constant value into the constant of the constraint. Using this technique it is able to animate anything using their respective constraint setup in Interface Builder.
